Under the Mongols,  Muslims served as administrators, generals, and other leaders who were transferred to China from Persia and Central Asia. There are 70 mosques in Beijing alone, and there are about 25 million Muslims in China.<br>In the Middle Ages, Christianity also played an important role in China. Nestorian Christians arrived in Tang China in the 7th century, memorialized in the Xi'an Steleâ€”a Tang monument that documents the presence of Christian communities in China. In the 13th century, numerous Christian missionaries and monks traveled to China, including  John of Montecorvino, sent by the pope to meet with Kublai Khan. He built the first Catholic Church in Beijing in 1305 and boasted thousands of converts. "

The Bhakti movement emphasizes a personal relationship with and devotion to a particular Hindu deity (such as Shiva or Vishnu). Devotional practices could include singing hymns of praise to the deity, writing devotional poems, or taking a pilgrimage to a sacred site associated with the deity. While in Calicut, you see the Virupaksha Temple (below), built by a Vijayanagara emperor and devoted to Lord Virupaksha, a local form of Shiva.";

Kashgar has a large Uigher population, a Turkic minority ethinc group, the majority of whom are Muslim (and currently, unfortunately, discriminated against in China)."
