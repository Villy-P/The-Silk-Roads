The guild is actually a confederation of guilds and trade towns in Central and Northern Europe. The League (also called the Hansa) essentially has a monopoly over trade from Portugal in the west to England in the north, Russia in the east and Venice in the south. Merchants of the Hansa bring eastern goods to the rest of Europe. The trade fairs of Northern Europe have provided a market for expanding trade, and Northern Europe has a few goods of its own to offer to the east.";
